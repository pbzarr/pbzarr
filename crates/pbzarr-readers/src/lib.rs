//! Input-format readers for pbzarr. This crate owns format-specific git
//! dependencies (currently `d4`), keeping them out of the core `pbzarr`
//! crate's manifest so `pbzarr` stays publishable to crates.io (which rejects
//! git dependencies). Each format's reader plugs into the core `ValueReader`
//! pipeline; the `from_<format>` functions are the bulk-import entry points.
//! Future formats (bed, bedgraph, bigwig) will land as sibling modules.
